    "### Part 3.1 Q&A:\n",
    "1. Explain how the appropriate bit-error probability is calculated in Python for a transmission power of 1 watt.\n",
    "   * Assume using 1 watt of power to send speech at 128k(Fs:8000 x NB:16) bits per second, and 50db(factor 10^-5) loss over channel.\n",
    "   * Eb = power/128k/10^5 = 1.0/128k/10^5\n",
    "   * Channel bandwidth: 30000Hz, Noise power is 300 x 10^-9 watts\n",
    "   * The power spectral density, N0 = (300^10-9)/30000  = 10 x 10^-12 watts/Hz \n",
    "   * Bit-error probability bep = 0.5 x erfc((Eb/N0)^0.5)\n",
    "2. Show how the required graph of bit-error probability against Eb/No (in dB) is produced in Python.\n",
    "   * First, set a numpy array for \"Eb/N0\"s\n",
    "   * Then, calculate \"Eb/N0\"(convert to dB: 10 x np.log10(x)) as x and Bit-error probability(0.5 x erfc(x^0.5)) as y\n",
    "   * Finally, set y axis scale as \"log\" and plot the graph\n",
    "3. What is the bit-error probability when the transmission power is 1 watt?\n",
    "   * 3.86 x 10^-5\n",
    "4. Explain how the evenly distributed bit-errors are introduced.\n",
    "   * First, convert the speech(numpy array) we read from file to bit array by using provided numpy_array_to_bit_array function\n",
    "   * Then use provided function insert_bit_errors(generate random evenly distributed erros with np.random.uniform according to given bep, and to exclusive-or with speech bit array) to add certain bit-errors to the bit array according to our bep(bit-error probability)\n",
    "   * Finally, convert the bit array of speech with bit-errors back to numpy array by using provided bit_array_to_numpy_array function\n",
    "5. What is the new bit-error probability (for 1.35 watts) and how was this calculated?\n",
    "   * Assume using 1.35 watt of power to send speech at 128k bits per second, and 50db(factor 10^-5) loss over channel.\n",
    "   * Eb = power/128k/10^5 = 1.35/128k/10^5\n",
    "   * Channel bandwidth: 30000Hz, Noise power is 300 x 10^-9 watts\n",
    "   * The power spectral density, N0 = (300^10-9)/30000  = 10 x 10^-12 watts/Hz \n",
    "   * bit-error probability bep = 0.5 x erfc((Eb/N0)^0.5) = 2.19 x 10^-6\n",
    "6. What is the PESQ score for the narrowband speech transmitted with 1.35 watts?\n",
    "   * Around 4.113 (each time is different).\n",
    "7. How is the talk time affected?\n",
    "   * watt = joule/s, since our phone has limited amount of battery, the more power we use for transmission, the less talk time will be available.\n",
    "   * For example, assume our phone has battery of 18000 joules,\n",
    "   * For 1 watt, we will have 18000/1 = 18000s talk time;\n",
    "   * For 1.35 watt, we will have 18000/1.35 = 13333.3s talk time.\n",
    "8. Explain in about one sentence how battery life and bit-error rates are connected.\n",
    "   * Since we got less bit-errors using more power for transmission, and more power result in worse battery life, therefore, the lower bit-error rates we get, the worse battery life we get."

    "2. What is the effect of the 3-fold increase in bit-rate on the transmit power and on the energy required to transmit the speech segment?\n",
    "   * In part 3.3, we use the same conditons as part 3.2, so the transmit power will remain the same, and it means that we will need 3 times power for transmission.\n",

    "1. If the CRC8 check succeeds, can we deduce that there are no bit-errors? \n",
    "   * No. Any combination of bit-errors that 'adds' any 'multiple' of G(x) will not be detected.\n",
    "2. If the CRC8 check fails, can we deduce that there are some bit-errors? \n",
    "   * Yes.\n",
    "3. Explain how your results demonstrate the effect of evenly distributed bit-errors and ARQ with various values of bit-error probability.\n",
    "   * As the bit-error probability increases, there are more likely to be more evenly distributed bit-erros, so that ARQ will require more retransmissions, and when the bit-error probability is at a very large value(around 0.01), ARQ may fail completely.\n",
    "4. For what values of bit-error probability did the ARQ process fail completely?\n",
    "   * Each time the results can be different, but it is very likely that the ARQ process fail completely when bit-error probability is around 0.005623413251903491."

    "### Part 3.5 Q&A:\n",
    "1. What could the ARQ mechanism above do if a numerical or string array is received correctly but bit-errors have occurred in the CRC8 check-bits?  How often might this occur?\n",
    "   * It will fail CRC check and require retransmission, but it is very rare to happen.\n",
    "2. State whether you consider ARQ as used in Part 3.4 an efficient method, and explain the reasons for your answer.\n",
    "   * It is not very efficient because each time we are doing the same thing from scratch again and have the same probability of avoiding errors, and hoping we can be lucky enough. However, if we do it like Part 3.5, we can absorb the failing experience when we do the voting, which increase our probability of succeeding, and we save time to do less resending, we even get better results on high bit-error probability situations.\n",
    "3. Explain your mechanism for combining failed retransmissions.\n",
    "   * We firstly allow up to 3 times retransmissions, if we can success within 3 tries, the function stops. Otherwise, instead of retransmit again, we do as follows:\n",
    "     * For each bit in the text bits array, we vote by selecting the most common bit according to the 3 failed bits array for our new bits array.\n",
    "     * After we get the voting text bits array, we do the same CRC checking as we did after transmission previously, and check whether the voting text can pass CRC or not, we can also print out the new text and compare with the original text to see the chase combining performance. \n",
    "4. Demonstrate the effect of combining 3 failed transmissions. \n",
    "   * It works pretty well, even if bep is around 0.01 (3.4 ARQ definitely failed completey), our chase combining method still can get the correct results. Even for situations where failed completely, we can get less errors than part 3.4.\n",
    "5. At what value of beP does the new ARQ process fail completely? Is there any improvement over what we got before?\n",
    "   * Every time the results are different, however, it is very likely that ARQ fails if bep reaches 0.03.\n",
    "   * The improvement is significant, sometime we can correct high bep(like around 0.01), and the average bep for new ARQ process to fail completely is higher than the previous one.\n",
    "6. If combining failed transmissions turns out to be a good idea, why is it not used in practice, for example in wifi (you need to look this up).\n",
    "   * Current wifi not using harq(chase combine and incremental redundancy), mainly because:\n",
    "     * Concerns regarding combining retransmissions in the wifi(unlicensed band) which is (sometimes) highly interfered:\n",
    "       * Impossible to know which transmission and retransmission should be combined.\n",
    "       * Failure due to decoding error and collisions are not distinguished(we prefer not to combine collision failed transmissions).\n",
    "       * Combining blindly different transmissions could result combining incorrect data from different         transmitters.\n",
    "       * Incorrectly received data may not be even intended for receiver doing the combining\n",
    "     * Overheads for extra works and implementation difficulties for using HARQ\n",
    "   * Do think people are researching on incorporating HARQ into 802.11 standard.\n",
